# Blacklist by Country, for NodeBB

This plugin allows administrators to ban entire countries from registering and logging in. Please be aware that this
is a heavy-handed approach and should not be used lightly (or temporarily)!

This plugin was made in response to repeated spammers coming only from Korean IP addresses.

Suffering from spammers? Try the following first:

1. [nodebb-plugin-spam-be-gone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodebb-plugin-spam-be-gone)
1. Blacklist entire IP ranges in the IP Blacklist page (e.g. `123.456.0.0/16`)
1. If all else fails, try this plugin for a week or so until they give up.
